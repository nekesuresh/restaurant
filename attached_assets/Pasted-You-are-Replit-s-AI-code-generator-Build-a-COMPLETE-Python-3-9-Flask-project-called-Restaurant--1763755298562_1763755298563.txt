You are Replit’s AI code generator. Build a COMPLETE Python 3.9+ Flask project called **“Restaurant Review Sentiment Analysis System”** that follows this user manual and matches the attached UI screenshots as closely as possible (layout, colors, fonts, and texts).

############################
## PURPOSE / FUNCTIONALITY
############################

Create a small AI web app that:
- Takes restaurant reviews as input.
- Classifies them as **positive**, **negative**, or **neutral** using a simple sentiment model.
- Shows a **Good result screen** (thumbs-up emoji), a **Bad result screen** (sad emoji), or a **Neutral result screen**.
- Provides:
  - Single-review prediction via UI.
  - A batch prediction script for CSV files.
  - A retraining script that can update the model with new labeled data.

Use Python, Flask, scikit-learn, pandas, and joblib (or pickle). No external APIs.

## BACKEND LOGIC
############################

1. **Model**
   - Build a simple scikit-learn pipeline:
     - TfidfVectorizer for text.
     - LogisticRegression (or similar) for classification.
   - Train on a small hard-coded demo dataset inside setup.py (e.g., positive/negative restaurant sentences) just so the model works out of the box.
   - Save it to `model/model.joblib` using joblib.

2. **setup.py**
   - When run (`python setup.py`):
     - Check if `model/model.joblib` exists.
     - If not, train the default model and save it.
     - Print something like “Model initialized and saved to model/model.joblib”.

3. **Flask app (app.py)**
   - Load the saved pipeline from `model/model.joblib` at startup.
   - Use Flask with:
     - Route **`/` (GET)**:
       - Render `index.html` with the input text area and Predict button.
     - Route **`/predict` (POST)**:
       - Receive review text from form.
       - Basic validation: if empty or too short, redirect back with an error message.
       - Use the model to predict sentiment label: "positive", "negative", or "neutral".
       - Depending on the label:
         - Render `result_good.html` for positive.
         - Render `result_bad.html` for negative.
         - Render `result_neutral.html` for neutral.
     - Register a **404 error handler** that renders `404.html`.
   - Run on host 0.0.0.0 and **port 8000** so it matches `http://localhost:8000`.

4. **batch_predict.py**
   - Usage: `python batch_predict.py --input reviews.csv --output results.csv`
   - Read a CSV file with a single column named **review**.
   - Use the same saved model to predict sentiment for each row.
   - Write out `results.csv` containing both the original review and predicted label.
   - Print a friendly message indicating how many reviews were processed.

5. **retrain.py**
   - Usage: `python retrain.py --data new_data.csv`
   - Read a CSV containing two columns: **review** and **label**.
   - Train a new scikit-learn pipeline on this dataset.
   - Overwrite `model/model.joblib` with the new model.
   - Print “Retraining complete. Restart the app to use the new model.”

############################
## FRONTEND / UI (MUST MATCH SCREENSHOTS)
############################

GENERAL STYLE:
- Use a clean sans-serif font (e.g., system UI or similar).
- Use centered content.
- Use the **same texts, layout and colors** as in the screenshots.

1. **Index page (`index.html`) – teal gradient header**
   - Top section: a full-width **teal-to-blue gradient** header, similar to the screenshot.
     - Large centered white title: `RESTAURANT REVIEW SENTIMENT ANALYSIS` (all caps).
     - Subtitle line in smaller white font: `Please write your review in the box to check whether the review was Good or Bad`.
   - Below the header, center a label text: **“Enter your review here”**.
   - Under the label, place a large white `<textarea>` with a light gray border and rounded corners (similar size and proportions to the screenshot).
   - Below the textarea, center a **“Predict”** button:
     - White background.
     - Black text “Predict”.
     - Rounded pill-shaped border with black outline, as shown in the screenshot.
   - Page background below the header should be white.

2. **Positive result page (`result_good.html`) – green bars + thumbs up**
   - Top: solid **olive green / dark green** bar spanning full width.
     - White uppercase title: `RESTAURANT REVIEW SENTIMENT ANALYSIS`.
     - Subtitle in white: `Let's see whether people reviewed your restaurant Good or a Bad`.
   - Under the header, in black bold text:
     - `Prediction:` (black and bold) followed by
     - `Good Job!!! Looks like people seem to enjoy food` in bold **dark green**, exactly like the screenshot.
   - In the center of the page, display a **large thumbs-up smiling emoji** (you can just use a Unicode emoji styled with a very large font-size, e.g. 140–160px).
   - Below the emoji, show a second line of centered dark-green text:
     - `Good job, seems like people enjoy the food`
     - Use large font size, bold, in dark green.
   - At the bottom of the page, add a thin full-width green bar similar to the screenshot.
   - Also provide a small “Back” or “Try another review” button linking to `/`.

3. **Negative result page (`result_bad.html`) – green bars + sad emoji**
   - Same solid green header and bottom bar as the positive page.
   - Under the header show:
     - `Prediction: Can try better next time` in black, centered, as per the screenshot.
   - In the middle, display a large **sad emoji** (downturned eyebrows and mouth).
   - Optionally, at the bottom center, display a line like:
     - `Can try better next time` in dark green.
   - Include a “Back” or “Try another review” button linking to `/`.

4. **Neutral result page (`result_neutral.html`)**
   - Same header and footer green bars.
   - Show a line like:
     - `Prediction: Looks okay, might be neutral overall`
   - Show a **neutral face emoji** in the middle (straight mouth).
   - Add a summary line in dark green, e.g. `Seems like reviews are mixed or neutral`.
   - Include a “Back” button linking to `/`.

5. **404 page (`404.html`) – error screenshot**
   - Same green top bar with the same title and subtitle.
   - In the center of the body, reproduce the error layout:
     - Large centered text: `404 Error`.
     - Below it, much larger `404`.
     - Below that, `Not Found`.
   - Use black text and similar spacing as in the screenshot.
   - Bottom green bar same as result pages.
   - Optional small link “Back to Home” that routes to `/`.

6. **style.css**
   - Contains all colors, fonts, margins, paddings, and shared layout rules.
   - Use CSS to:
     - Create the teal gradient header for index (`linear-gradient`).
     - Create the solid green bars for the other pages.
     - Center all main content.
     - Style the textarea width (~60% of page on desktop) and height (~200px).
     - Give the Predict button the pill shape with hover effect (e.g., subtle box-shadow or background change).

############################
## USER MANUAL BEHAVIOR (LOGIC)
############################

Implement the behavior described:

- When user opens `/`:
  - They see the main input UI as above.
- When they type a review and click **Predict**:
  - The backend:
    - Validates the input (not empty).
    - Sends it to the model.
    - Based on the prediction, renders the corresponding result template.
- The system should handle:
  - Empty or nonsense input by either:
    - Showing an error on the index page, OR
    - Redirecting with a flash message.
- batch_predict.py and retrain.py should follow:
  - `python batch_predict.py --input reviews.csv --output results.csv`
  - `python retrain.py --data new_data.csv`

############################
## REQUIREMENTS.TXT
############################

Add at least these packages:

Flask
scikit-learn
pandas
joblib
numpy

############################
## README.md
############################

Create a README that summarizes the user manual in simple steps:

- System requirements (MacOS Monterey+, Ubuntu 20.04+, Windows 10+; 8GB+ RAM, ideally 16GB; Python 3.9+; browser; optional GPU).
- Installation:
  1. Install Python 3.9+.
  2. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
  3. `python setup.py`
  4. `python app.py`
  5. Open `http://localhost:8000` in a browser.
- How to:
  - Enter a single review and click Predict.
  - Use `batch_predict.py` for multiple reviews at once.
  - Use `retrain.py` with `review,label` CSV to retrain.
  - Stop the app with Ctrl + C.

Make sure the app starts without modification when run with `python setup.py` then `python app.py`, and that the UI looks as close as possible to the provided screenshots.
